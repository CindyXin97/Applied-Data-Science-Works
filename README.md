# Applied-Data-Science-Works

   
This is profolio using basic skills and tools necessary to address data science 
problems. It includes a wide variety of tools currently used in applied data science, from basic 
regression analysis, clustering and classification to more advanced topics, such as deep learning and 
network science and heavily relies on Python on the implementation end.


## Other Learning Materials Related
These course works are all practice-oriented, with only basic concepts and necessary minimum of 
the theoretic material attached. More learning materials related are attached below:

To learn more basic theory and concepts about machine learning. Lectures by Professor Andrew Ng for Machine Learning (CS 229) in the Stanford Computer Science department are recommended:
